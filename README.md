# Guessing Game

# On load, page 'chooses' a number, which the user must guess, and tell if too high, too low, or correct guess.

# WHAT I LEARNED
> I had some previous training about object oriented languages, so this was not an entirely new topic for me.
> It was, however, the first significant project I made using jQuery to interact with page style or structure.
> Initial practice exercises were a very new and unfamiliar experiences for me, but by the time this project was finished,
> I feel I had a decent, basic grasp of how to use jQuery. Simple topics of getting input, executing code based on input,
> and changing HTML or CSS displayed in response.

# TO DO
> Allow multiple players on same game to take turns


# ADDITIONAL FEATURES ADDED
> Range Response/Visual Cues - background color changes depending on how far above/below the most recent guess was,
>   blue low, red high, green when match found.
> Make responsive to screen size
> Make program structure more Object-oriented
